Preservation of Tribes 1 content.

In most cases, the content is be provided via the repository in fully-extracted state.

**Note:** In cases where there are missing directories (such as missing *temp* or *Recordings* directories in the installations), this is due to the fact that Git repositories will not include empty directories. In most cases, the missing directories do not create a problem, as they will be created by the game when it needs them. However, it may make things look a little strange if you're used to seeing them!

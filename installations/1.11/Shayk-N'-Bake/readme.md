# Tribes 1.11 by Shayk-N'-Bake

This is Tribes 1.11 vanilla by Shayk-N'-Bake. This installation was created using a 1.8-version CD as a starting point, which was then patched to version 1.11 using the official 1.8-to-1.11 patch file provided from Dynamix.

Beyond the patch to version 1.11, the only additions to this setup are:
- NoFiX's mem.dll that includes Andrew's functions from his LastHope/Hudbot mem.dll, as well as NoFiX's Vista Fix update.
- Shayk-N'-Bake MasterServers.cs file for generating the master server address variable to more easily point to the community master servers. The array for the addresses can easily be edited from within the file. If the array is edited while Tribes is already running, you can update the actual address variable in-game by simply executing the file: `exec(MasterServers);`.

Due to size restrictions, the installation has been uploaded into 25MB partitions. You can use [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the installation.

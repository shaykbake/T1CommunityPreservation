This is Tribes 1.11 compiled by myself (Shayk-N'-Bake). It was put together using a 1.8 version CD disc that I originally owned, patched to version 1.11 using Dynamix's 1.8-1.11 patch binary.

I have also included the following additions:
- NoFiX's mem.dll that features everything from Andrew's LastHope mem.dll and also includes NoFiX's Vista Patch.
- My own MasterServers.cs script file for generating the master server address variable to easily point to community-hosted master servers. You can edit the array of master server addresses easily from within the file. If you do so after starting Tribes, simply execute the file again from console: `exec(MasterServers);`.

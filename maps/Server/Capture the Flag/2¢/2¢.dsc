Though it is unfinished and hardly defended (hence the name 2¢ on defense). They want to be the ones with their names on it. So they set up the flags and put on their war faces. 5 captures will win the game, but control of both levels on the tower will add an extra point each level! So prepare for a gruesome battle." @

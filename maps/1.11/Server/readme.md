# Server Maps
These maps are not required to be present within the client Tribes installation to play on a server. They utilize *.ted files of other maps instead.

**Note:** Some files listed here may rely on *.ted files of other maps that are not, by default, included in most Tribes clients. They simply don't have a dedicated *.ted file for it. If you are unable to play one of these maps due to missing the *.ted file for it, then you can open the map file to determine what *.ted file you need to grab from the *Client* map files.

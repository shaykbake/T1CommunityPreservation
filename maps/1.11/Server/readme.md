# Server Maps
These maps do not have unique data files that are required to be present within the client Tribes installation to be played on a server.

**Note:** It is still possible that one of these maps uses data files that are not included in a standard Tribes installation. If you are unable to play one of these maps due to missing a required file, view the *.mis file to determine which *.ted file the map is referencing and ensure that you have the map the *.ted file belongs to in your setup.

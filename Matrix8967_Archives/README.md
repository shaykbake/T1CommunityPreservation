# Matrix8967 Starsiege Tribes Archives:

Starsiege Tribes had a huge impact on me both personally *and* technically.

To help with the preservation & archival efforts, I managed to sift through all my original Tribes files and pull out many of the Mods, Maps, and Development Tools I've collected over the years.

# Content:

* Directory_Map.md
  └── A plain text list of the directory structure -- useful for parsing.

* Images
  └── Luis Royo's original T1 artwork -- AI Upscaled to be at a modern resolution.

* Missions
  └── T1 Map Files.

* Mods
  └── UltraRenegadesVX4 & UltraRenegadesVX5 Installation Files.

* Skins
  └── A grab-bag of cool & cringe skins I downloaded. 😂️

* Tools
  ├── The official Development tools released by `Dynamix.`
  └── I *THINK* the Development Tools were released shortly after the release of `Tribes2` - but I maybe mistaken...

# Notes:

I haven't tested these with a new/vanilla T1 install, but I'm sure it's fine...

# Tribes 1.41 Installations

These are full installations of Tribes 1.41. These are probably the best versions to use as client setups for playing the game now.

## Installation Descriptions

### Tribes 1.41 Original by Plasmatic

An “original” version of Tribes for the 1.41 setup in a portable 7z file. It includes Tribes patched to version 1.41, and also includes several popular map packs such as DOX, LT and Open Call.

*This was taken from Plasmatic’s (now defunct?) tribes0.com website and recompiled by Shayk-N’-Bake with a few unnecessary files removed to reduce size. It is roughly 25 MB smaller than the original download.*
